## Programming  
Still a work in progress.

Perhaps this hardware: https://github.com/hackup/ATF2FT232HQ

Perhaps this software: https://snowgoons.ro/posts/2020-11-25-atf15xx-vhdl-development-for-cheap/

Supposedly there is a way to use openocd too, but the openocd docs are confusing.  
Need actual sample commands to start from...  
`openocd -c "adapter driver list"`
